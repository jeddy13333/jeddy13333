- Hi, I’m Jerrod
- We live in such amazing and wonderous times, technology is at levels of what I thought
  would only be possible in SciFi movies. I have been inspired to document my journey through learning;
  coding, hacking, hardware...
  and whatever else comes up... lets build the future we want, for the better.
- I am currently learning on 'vanilla' JavaScript. My goal is to build sites using three.js. 
  but you must crawl before you can walk, walk before you can run. 
- I am also an active member of TryHackMe! I love this site! Such an awesome concept. Learned a ton about 
  hacking and how the Internets are all put together. I would love to watch old '90s hacking movies 
  and never thought I would be able to do what they did, epic. The whole culture was fascinating. I know that 
  these movies were a gross misiterpretation of what its really like. But its entertainment. with that being 
  said; The future of this account will have programing and I guess "tips and tricks" for hacking.
- How to reach me ... Coming soon....
